# Capmap

## Development

### Python

Python is currently used just as a way to script downloading all of the cab data csv files

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `apt-get install npm`

### Frontend

[Download](https://www.mapbox.com/help/demos/heatmap/trees.geojson) data file and place in the data directory
open `public/index.html` in your browser

## TODO

- Finish download script 
- Change map to NYC rather than Pittsburgh
- Write method to convert tax data to geo-json or have method to convert in on the fly
