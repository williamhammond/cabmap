# Capmap

## Development

### Python

Python is currently used just as a way to script downloading all of the cab data csv files

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `apt-get install npm`

### JS

- `npm install mapbox-gl --save`

Then you need to add your configurations to the `dev.env` file. [Here](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/) are instructions on how to get a Mapbox token
